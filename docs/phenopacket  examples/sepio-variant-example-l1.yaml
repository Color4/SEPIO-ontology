schema: phenopacket-level-1

comment: This is an exploratory example of what the very simple evidence metadata would look like using the SEPIO model in a variant-phenotype phenopacket.  This example is taken directly from the github phenopacket-format repo, and the SEPIO model implemented to capture evidence - which here includes only a ECO evidence type and a supporting publication.  A much more complex example of evidence for an ACMG Guideline-based variant interpretation can also be found in the SEPIO repo (variant-disease-clingen_example_v2.yaml).

comment: This is an example phenopacket containing one variant to phenotype association
