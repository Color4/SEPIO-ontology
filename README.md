# SEPO-ontology

The **Scientific Evidence and Provenance Ontology (SEPO)** was developed to support description of evidence and provenance information for scientific claims, with a focus on those found in curated research databases. Use cases driving SEPO development include integration of scientific claims and their associated evidence/provenance metadata, and support for discovery, analysis, and evaluation of claims based on this metadata. 

In the SEPO framework, ***evidence*** is defined as information as used to evaluate the validity of a claim. ***Provenance*** is the process history leading to a claim being made, including processes through which evidence is evaluated, and processes through which  information used as evidence is created. Provenance metadata includes accounts of who conducted these processes, what entities participated in them, and when/where they occurred. 

The core of the SEPO model is set of related informational entities representing **propositions**, **assertions**, **evidence lines**, and **supporting data**.  These concepts are commonly referenced, implicitly or explicitly, across various formal models related to evidence and provenance for scientific claims [1,2,3,4], and are rooted in philosophical accounts of reasoning, argument, and discourse. Around these core informational concepts, SEPO provides a minimal but extensible model of related process and process participants that are necessary to address its driving use cases and requirements. 

The following **Wiki pages** provide additional information about the SEPO ontology and its support for structuring evidence and provenance metadata around scientific claims.
